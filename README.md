I'm the CEO of 株式会社ＴＩ東京 (aka TI Tokyo), at which we work on various IT consulting projects with a special focus on Riak KV, Riak CS and Riak TS

I'm a fan of Riak, Erlang, Docker, Visual Studio Code, C#, and Powershell. 
I like to think I'm pretty good at regex, but everyone is delutional about something.
I also dabble in Go, PHP, and various scripting languages to make life easier.

I enjoy cooking (which only partially explains my waistline), building large Lego sets, and solving puzzles.
